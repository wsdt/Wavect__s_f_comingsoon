## What was Wavect?
Wavect has been a Tech-Startup to offer low-priced and personalized Corporate-Social-Responsibility campaigns to SMEs. We basically built a social-platform where people can solve so-called challenges related to environment-protection, health and solidarity and win prizes based on their interests by companies they love (e.g. exclusive rebates, products, vouchers, ...).
